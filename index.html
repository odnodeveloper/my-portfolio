			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p>Learning foreign lnaguages was one of my hobbies, but later it became my profession. Although it is challenging to change 
			your career and start over from scratch, I believe that my experience and background would help me to learn another 'language'  
			specifically, programming languages.</p>
			<p>As a student at Thinkful, I have begun my joirney to becoming a Software Engineer and couldn't be happier.</p>
			<p>If you are looking to hire a Software Engineer, please reach out. I am so excited to work with other developers on projects.</p>
