			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>Learning foreign lnaguages was one of my hobbies, and later it became my profession. It is challenging to change 
			your career and start over different one from scratch, however, I believe that my current experience and passion for
			gaining new skills would help me to learn another 'language', specifically, a coding language.</p>
			<p>As a student at Thinkful, I have already begun my journey to taking challenges in my next career. My multilingual 
			ability and excellent communication skills, as well as, the knowledge gained from the Engineering Flex course along
			with my enthasiasm for mastering the profession would make me a great asset to any organization.</p>
			<p>If you are looking to hire someone who has no work experience but is eager to learn and has a positive attitute, 
			please reach out. I am so excited to work with other developers on various projects.</p>
